To execute and run all four algorithms using the arrays in MSS_Problems.txt, 
use the following command:

python algorithms.py

This will run all four algorithms and output the results to MSS_Results.txt.
The formatting for MSS_Results.txt is as follows:

<Algorithm Name> Results:

<Original Array>
<Max Sub-Array>
<Total Value of Max Sub-Array>

This is repeated for each array tested, with the results for each algorithm 
listed under their respective section. 

Additionally, this program will output the average running times for each array
tested in a .txt file with the name of the algorithm tested. To run this, 
uncomment the last four lines of main()
